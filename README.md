# Path Planning Based on Astar for Soccer Robots
 This repository includes a path-planning algorithm for soccer robots. It applys Astar with inflation for static path-planning and Astar with artificial potential field for dynamic path-planning. 
 
All these C++ codes are complete solutions to three tasks in a course called Robotics Augmented Training in Zhejiang University. 

Task1: Static Path-planning.
Task2: Dynamic Path-planning in a senario where there are 8 robots walking randomly.
Task3: Dynamic Path-planning in a senario where there are 6 robots always blocking you.
